     <h1>Description</h1>
     <p>This dish is simple but elegant, and excellent if you're looking for something that's full of flavor without the heaviness of a cream sauce. Garnish with grated Asiago cheese as desired.</p>
     
     <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided

        <li>1 (16 ounce) package fresh linguine pasta
        
        <li>1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
        
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
        
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic
        
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, cut up
        
        <li>1/4 cup grated Asiago cheese, or to taste
        </ul>

     <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water and 1 tablespoon oil to a boil. Cook linguine in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and saute until shrimp turns pink, 3 to 4 minutes. Add basil and garlic; cook for 2 to 3 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Add butter and cooked linguine. Toss until butter melts, making sure to coat the linguine with the sauce. Remove from heat. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
